    EXTRA CREDIT QUESTIONS
    
      - You have a Linux server, remotely accessed over SSH.  Your user is a
        sudoer.  You have ten minutes to do as much damage as you can manage
        to the system before the machine loses power.  What steps do you take?

		Assuming you are going for pure damage and not information gathering, I would either:

		rm -rf /* (to avoid the safety checks on newer Linux installs)

		Determine disk (or any block) devices.
		Run dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX for all the devices are you want to make difficult to recover.

		Install systemd and reboot (I kid, I kid)
    
      - What are your three favorite acronyms?

		NSA, CIA, FBI (they're listening - don't upset them!)
    
      - Draw us a piece of ASCII art from scratch.

		O|||||||O

		That's my Jeep from the front :)

      - If we had wanted to make this really difficult, how should we have
        obscured these questions?

		Hash the contents and require <$5 AWS investment in resources to brute force it. Cheap and telling of the candidate's skills.
    
      - Stones or Beatles?

		I grew up with Beatles fans and appreciate the music, but I have to say the Stones for the deeper, thought provoking concepts.
