Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

	45k-60k would be nice. I'm making 47k at DreamHost.

2. When can you start?
	
	I'd like to give DreamHost at least a month to find someone else, but two weeks minimum.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

	Nope.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing a dog to work?

	Seriously?!?! That's fine with me! I wouldn't bring my dog to work because he's aggressive toward other dogs. But I love dogs!

5. The active sysadmin keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

	I am subscribed to a few mailing lists. I've also read 2600 since I was about 14 years old, although it's not exactly on a frequent release schedule.  and I have a lot of friends that are sysadmins or software developers, from DreamHost and other places. They tend to post a lot of stuff on Facebook that is related to security or software development. There's also Ars Technica and Slashdot, of course.  And the great Reddit.

6. The sane sysadmin does things other than managing systems. What else occupies your time?

	Lately I've been growing a lot of exotic plants -- chocolate vine, passionflower, caucasian vine spinach, beetberry, tiger melon, black prince tomatoes, pineberries and angelica -- indoors in a hydroponic system. When it's warm out, I hope to get some of these cuttings rooted in the ground and have a proper garden. Aside from that, there are the frequent company-sponsored parties at DreamHost and I have a five-year-old nephew. I also like playing video games, although lately I haven't had much time for that.

7. The worldly sysadmin is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

	I usually scan through /r/books for good recommendations. Music-wise, I'm pretty narrow in my preferences, mostly crass punk rock and 60's songwriters.
	I've got a few friends that are movie buffs, and we usually watch films either on Netflix or (gasp) download a torrent or two several times a week.
