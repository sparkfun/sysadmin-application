Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
	$40K - my current compensation + transportation to Niwot
	$65K - glassdoor.com's national average for system administrators

2. When can you start?
 	August 1 (most likely)
	We're closing on a house on July 29. The mortgage company told me not to change employment until after my application is complete.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
	Yes. We're going to L.A. and Houston to see family Sept 10 through 20. I know. It breaks my heart that I'm going to miss AVC. We planned around weddings instead of robotics. Next time I'll put my foot down!

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing a dog to work?
	Woof! I don't have a dog yet, but probably some day I'll bring one to work.

5. The active sysadmin keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
	Twitter and the water cooler. I actually read some email newsletters too.

6. The sane sysadmin does things other than managing systems. What else occupies your time?
	- Electronics. I cruise Hackster.io for inspiration on a near daily basis.
	- Carpentry. I plan to build a [pantorouter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDPrFJazD3Q) soon because I love mortise and tenon joinery. 
	- See my [maker blog](https://patrick3coffee.wordpress.com) for a few recent projects.
	- We participate in a working farm share. The new house will also have a garden.
	- Making the baby smile. 

7. The worldly sysadmin is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
	- I like listening to "radio" style streaming music. I get to discover new stuff that way.
	- We have a season pass to the local musical dinner theater.
