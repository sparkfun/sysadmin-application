I could perhaps include my shell configuration from my environment at DreamHost, but it wouldn't really make much sense without an understanding of DreamHost's architecture and it's probably their property anyway.

I added the .vimrc from my current desktop and a .bashrc with a function I used on an old machine I had a long time ago that hosted VMs... they are pretty sparse, though :/
