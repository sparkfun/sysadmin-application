We observe that the experienced nerd often prefers tools which afford a measure of customization, and that most hackers accrue some amount of configuration for editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like.

This section may, at your option, contain either:

  a) A collection of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same.

Responses will be evaluated for both style and content.




When it comes to tools, I'm usually content with the plain vanilla default settings. I know that sounds lame, but I don't have much to show for customization. 

One exception: I greatly appreciate tab completion and color on the command line. I recently started using some of [Matthias Bynens dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). They're not my own, so I probably shouldn't upload someone else's dotfiles.
