Hey! 
The PDF is something I wrote back when I worked at LunarPages, and circulated it to the level 1 guys so they could help mitigate a huge flood of WordFence-related crashes and wordpress bruteforce attempts. 

I also wrote a basic shell script, and included a code sample of a CherryPy webapp I was writing a while back.

Thanks for reading this stuff! I don't have a lot of contributions to open-source.. but working at SparkFun I'm sure I'd get plenty of opportunities to make some.
